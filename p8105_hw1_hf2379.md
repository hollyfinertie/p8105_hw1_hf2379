# Problem1

## Create a dataframe:

``` r
set.seed(1)

prob1_df = tibble(
  prob1_sample = rnorm(8, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  prob1_logic_vec = prob1_sample > 0,
  prob1_char_vec = c("I","Am", "A", "Little", "Confused", "Is", "This", "Right"),
  prob1_factor_vec = factor(c("yes", "no", "maybe", "yes", "no", "maybe", "yes", "no"))
)
```

## Mean of each variable:

  - **The mean of the sample size is 0.1314544**. We are able to take
    the mean because the sample size is a numeric data type.

  - **The mean of the logical statement is 0.625**. We are able to take
    the mean of the logical statement because it is a Boolean data type
    (TRUE=1 and FALSE=0). Even if the output is displayed as TRUE/FALSE,
    the values of 1 and 0 are in the background.

  - **The mean of the character vector is NA**. We are not able to take
    the mean of the character vector because it is text/character data
    type that does not correspond with numeric values. The error states
    that we can only take the mean of a numeric or logical argument.

  - **The mean of the factor vector is NA**. We are unable to take the
    mean of the factor vector because it is a text/character data type
    that does not correspond with numeric values. The error states that
    we can only take the mean of a numeric or logical argument.

## First Code Chunk: convert to numeric

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, prob1_logic_vec))
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, prob1_char_vec))
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, prob1_factor_vec))
```

The as.numeric function works on the logical and factor vectors, but not
the character vector.

**Logical**: Because the logical vector is a Boolean data type, we can
convert the TRUE / FALSE results to 1 / 0 respectively.

**Character**: I got the error “NAs introduced by coercion” showing that
the as.numeric function did not work on the character vector.

**Factor**: The as.numeric function works on the factor vector even when
we were unable to take the mean. Becuase there were 3 levels, the
as.numeric function converted the different levels to 1, 2, and
    3.

## Second Code Chunk: convert and multiply

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, prob1_logic_vec))*pull(prob1_df, prob1_sample)
```

    ## [1] 0.0000000 0.1836433 0.0000000 1.5952808 0.3295078 0.0000000 0.4874291
    ## [8] 0.7383247

``` r
as.factor(pull(prob1_df, prob1_logic_vec))*pull(prob1_df, prob1_sample)
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(as.factor(pull(prob1_df, prob1_logic_vec)),
    ## pull(prob1_df, : '*' not meaningful for factors

    ## [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(as.factor(pull(prob1_df, prob1_logic_vec)))*pull(prob1_df, prob1_sample)
```

    ## [1] -0.6264538  0.3672866 -0.8356286  3.1905616  0.6590155 -0.8204684
    ## [7]  0.9748581  1.4766494

**Numeric**: We were able to convert the logical vector to numeric
vector and multiply by our random sample.

**Factor**: We were unable to multiply the converted logical vector. We
got the error: ’\*’ not meaningful for factors.

**To Factor, to numeric**: We were able to convert the logical vector
into factor and then into numeric and multiply by our random sample.

# Problem 2

``` r
set.seed(2)

prob2_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  y = rnorm(500, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  prob2_logic_vec = (x + y) > 1,
  prob2_num_vec = as.numeric(prob2_logic_vec),
  prob2_factor_vec = as.factor(prob2_logic_vec)
)
```

## Describe new data frame

  - This dataset contains 500 rows and 5 columns.

  - The mean of x is 0.0616923.

  - The median of x is 0.0439172.

  - The standard deviation of x is 1.0323776.

  - The proportion of cases for which x + y \> 1 is
0.266.

## Plots

``` r
plot1 = ggplot(prob2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = prob2_logic_vec)) + geom_point()
plot1
```

![](p8105_hw1_hf2379_files/figure-gfm/problem2_plot_logical-1.png)<!-- -->

  - This plot has two colors, red and blue, because we set the colors to
    equal the logical vector which was two outcomes: FALSE and
TRUE.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
plot2 = ggplot(prob2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = prob2_num_vec)) + geom_point()
plot2
```

![](p8105_hw1_hf2379_files/figure-gfm/problem2_plot_nvector-1.png)<!-- -->

  - This plot’s colors range from light blue (1.0) to dark blue (0.0)
    because we set the color equal to the numeric vector which was
    outcomes 0 and 1. This numeric vector was created from the logical
    vector (TRUE=1 and FALSE=0). While the color legend provides a range
    of colors from 0-1, the output only shows dots that correspond to 0
    and 1 identical to plot 1
above.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
plot3 = ggplot(prob2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = prob2_factor_vec)) + geom_point()
plot3
```

![](p8105_hw1_hf2379_files/figure-gfm/problem2_plot_fvector-1.png)<!-- -->

  - This plot has two colors, red and blue, because we set the colors
    equal to the factor vector which was two outcomes: FALSE and TRUE.
    This factor vector was created from the logical vector and therefore
    the graph is identical to plot 1.

## Saving my first scatterplot

``` r
ggsave(plot1, file = "plot1.png")
```
