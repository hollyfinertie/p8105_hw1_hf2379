# Problem1

## Create a dataframe:

```{r problem1_variables}
prob1_df = tibble (
  prob1_sample = rnorm(8, mean=0, sd = 1),
  prob1_sample_over0 = prob1_sample > 0,
  prob1_char = c("I","Am", "A", "Little", "Confused", "Is", "This", "Right"),
  prob1_factor = factor(c("yes", "no", "maybe", "yes", "no", "maybe", "yes", "no"))
)
```
